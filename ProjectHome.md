**jPapaBench** is a Java version of the PapaBench benchmark, originally written in C. The benchmark is based on the Paparazzi project which provides a free implementation of an autopilot for unmanned aerial vehicles  (UAVs). The autopilot has been successfully tested on several real devices.

The main motivation for implementing a Java-based PapaBench version was to provide a realistic application benchmark that would allow comparison of different Java Virtual Machine implementations and different flavors of real-time Java. jPapaBench is available for plain Java, Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ), and Safety-Critical Java.
